Two sources code for grayscale image 
For Huffman coding, run huffman.py
For Huffman decoding, run de_huffman.py

-> de_huffman.py uses dictionary_meo.txt and imageinBit_meo.txt which are created by huffman.py to re-build the binary tree for decoding process
-> meo_decompress.png is the result after decompressing
